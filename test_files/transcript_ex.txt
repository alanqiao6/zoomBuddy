Sophia Martinez: I love these topics! **STEM careers excite me!** (identity)  

0:00:18 --> 0:00:22  
Instructor: Letâ€™s start by brainstorming ways to **reduce pollution** in urban areas.  

0:00:26 --> 0:00:30  
Liam Patel: We could create **a low-cost solar water heater**. (tinker, environment)  

0:00:35 --> 0:00:40  
Emma Chen: Thatâ€™s awesome! We should **experiment with different materials**. (tinker)  

0:00:42 --> 0:00:47  
Noah Williams: Imagine if **every building had built-in air purification systems**. (hypothesize, environment)  

0:00:50 --> 0:00:55  
Instructor: Thatâ€™s a great thought! How would we **test its efficiency?**  

0:01:00 --> 0:01:05  
Mia Johnson: We should set up **community-wide trials** to gather data. (community)  

0:01:10 --> 0:01:15  
Jacob Brown: My town started **a composting initiativeâ€”it reduced waste a lot**. (community)  

0:01:20 --> 0:01:25  
Ava Singh: My uncle works in **wind energyâ€”he says solar + wind combos are best**. (personal, environment)  

0:01:30 --> 0:01:35  
Henry Carter: Suppose we **design a mobile app that monitors individual carbon footprints**? (hypothesize, identity)  

0:01:40 --> 0:01:45  
Charlotte Rivera: Thatâ€™s a great idea! We should **promote STEM careers with this project**. (identity)  

0:01:50 --> 0:01:55  
Ethan Ramirez: **Why donâ€™t we just cover the whole planet in solar panels? ðŸ˜‚** (disruption)  

0:02:00 --> 0:02:10  
Instructor: Haha, letâ€™s aim for **feasible solutions!**  

0:02:12 --> 0:02:18  
Olivia White: What about **installing algae walls in cities to absorb COâ‚‚?** (tinker, environment)  

0:02:20 --> 0:02:25  
Lucas Parker: Maybe we can **build AI-powered energy management systems**. (hypothesize, environment)  

0:02:30 --> 0:02:35  
Instructor: Love the innovation! How do we ensure **access for rural communities?**  

0:02:40 --> 0:02:45  
Benjamin Scott: My grandpaâ€™s farm **runs on wind powerâ€”itâ€™s super effective**. (personal, community)  

0:02:50 --> 0:02:55  
Mateo Diaz: Could we **develop cheap, portable solar-powered batteries?** (tinker, environment)  

0:03:00 --> 0:03:05  
Harper Adams: People **need better environmental education to make smart choices**. (community)  

0:03:10 --> 0:03:15  
Ethan Ramirez: **ORRR what if we just outlaw cars and only use bikes? ðŸ˜‚** (disruption)  

0:03:20 --> 0:03:25  
Instructor: Thatâ€™sâ€¦an interesting thought!  

0:03:30 --> 0:03:40  
Instructor: Engineers are essential for sustainability. Whatâ€™s one **future idea per person?**  

0:03:45 --> 0:03:50  
Sophia Martinez: We need **more diversity in STEM fields!** (identity)  

0:03:55 --> 0:04:00  
Instructor: Great points! Letâ€™s wrap up with **final sustainability takeaways.**  

0:04:05 --> 0:04:10  
Emma Chen: **Letâ€™s document our research for future STEM students.** (identity, tinker)  

0:04:15 --> 0:04:20  
Leo Robinson: **AI should optimize city energy grids.** (hypothesize)  

0:04:25 --> 0:04:30  
Olivia White: **We need more government investment in green energy.** (community)  

0:04:35 --> 0:04:40  
Instructor: Fantastic ideas! See you next class.
