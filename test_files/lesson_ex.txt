### **📌 Lesson Structure**
#### **1️⃣ Introduction (5 minutes)**
- Brief discussion on **why sustainability matters** in technology & engineering.  
- Show **real-world examples** (e.g., Elon Musk’s sustainable energy projects, city pollution tracking sensors).  

---

#### **2️⃣ Problem-Solving Challenge (10 minutes)**
💡 **Scenario:**  
*"Imagine your city is struggling with air and water pollution. You and your team of engineers need to design an innovative solution that helps reduce environmental harm."*  

**Team Discussion:**  
- What **technologies** exist today that address pollution?  
- How can **STEM help communities** implement sustainability efforts?  

---

#### **3️⃣ Engineering Solutions (15 minutes)**
🛠️ **Hands-on Brainstorming Activity**  
Students work in teams to design a **solution prototype**, focusing on:  
✅ Water filtration systems (**environment, tinker**)  
✅ Solar-powered pollution detectors (**environment, tinker, identity**)  
✅ Carbon footprint tracking app (**hypothesize, identity**)  
✅ Community education campaign (**community, personal**)  

---

#### **4️⃣ Real-World Connections (10 minutes)**
🌎 **Case Studies:**  
- **Germany’s Renewable Energy Revolution** → How policies shape sustainability  
- **Kenya’s Solar-Powered Schools** → Impact of STEM in developing nations  
- **Flint, Michigan Water Crisis** → How students can advocate for change  

**Discussion Questions:**  
1. How do economic factors impact access to clean technology?  
2. What is the role of students in creating sustainable innovations?  
3. Should sustainability be **a personal responsibility or a government responsibility?**  

---

#### **5️⃣ Community Impact Discussion (10 minutes)**
💬 **How does STEM connect to real-world change?**  
- Students share **personal stories** of environmental issues in their hometowns.  
- Teams present **how their designs could be used in different communities (urban vs. rural).**  
- Debate: **Should local governments provide funding for sustainability projects?**  

---

#### **6️⃣ Conclusion & Next Steps (5 minutes)**
✅ Recap **key takeaways** from the session.  
✅ Encourage students to **research and refine** their prototype ideas.  
✅ Assign an **optional challenge**: Create a **one-minute pitch video** explaining their design!
